                        <p>My name is Allardyce Suba. I graduated from San Jose State University (SJSU) in May&nbsp;2016 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and great academic standing.</p>
                        <p>I am currently looking to further improve my technical skills and start my professional career in software development or a related field. I am a self-starter and have a passion for learning. I am constantly learning about new programming languages, software applications, keeping up with new technological development that would put me above others. In addition, I challenge myself by attempting to create from the skills that I have learned.</p>
